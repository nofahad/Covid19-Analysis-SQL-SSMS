# ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 DATA (2020-2022) USING SQLâ€“(MICROSOFT SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO)

## Data Analysis in SSMS and Data Visualisation in PowerBI 

### Objective:

This aim of this project is to gain insights into the Covid-19 pandemic by formatting the data (Feb 2020 - Dec 2022) in Microsoft Excel to begin with and then analysing the data in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio through data-driven queries. The datasets contain information on the various factors such as the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, rate of infection and vaccination rollout. 

Data Source: [Covis-19 Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

### Analysis:

To perform the analysis, the original dataset was divided into two separate datasets containing CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations records using Microsoft Excel. Created a new database named Covid19_Database in SSMS and then, these datasets were loaded into Microsoft SSMS for data-driven querying. The SQL script file with queries for exploratory analysis of this dataset is available to view in this repository.
